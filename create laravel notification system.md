1. First, you will need to install the `twilio/sdk` package, which provides a WhatsApp API client:
```
composer require twilio/sdk
```
2. Next, you will need to define a `toWhatsApp` method in the `InvoicePaid` notification class. This method should use the WhatsApp API client to send the notification:

```php
use Twilio\Rest\Client;

class InvoicePaid extends Notification
{
    // ...

    public function toWhatsApp($notifiable)
    {
        $client = new Client(
            config('services.twilio.sid'),
            config('services.twilio.token')
        );

        $client->messages->create(
            $notifiable->whatsapp_number,
            [
                'from' => config('services.twilio.whatsapp_from'),
                'body' => "Your invoice has been paid.\nInvoice number: {$this->invoice->number}\nInvoice amount: {$this->invoice->amount}"
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

3. Finally, you will need to modify the `via` method to specify that the notification should be delivered through WhatsApp:

```php
public function via($notifiable)
{
    return ['whatsapp'];
}
```

Here is an example of how you might use the `InvoicePaid` notification class in a controller to send a notification through WhatsApp:

```php
use App\Notifications\InvoicePaid;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;

class InvoiceController extends Controller
{
    public function pay(Invoice $invoice)
    {
        // Mark the invoice as paid
        $invoice->markAsPaid();

        // Send the notification
        Notification::send($invoice->customer, new InvoicePaid($invoice));

        return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'Invoice paid successfully!');
    }
}
```

Here is an example of how the `markAsPaid` method could be implemented on the `Invoice` model:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Invoice extends Model
{
    // ...

    public function markAsPaid()
    {
        $this->update(['paid' => true]);
    }
}
```

Yes, in order to use the `InvoicePaid` notification class to send a notification through WhatsApp, you will need to set up a service provider and register it in the `config/app.php` file.

A service provider is a class that bootstraps a specific service in your Laravel application. In this case, you will need to create a service provider to set up the WhatsApp API client and register it with Laravel's notification system.

Here's an example of how you might create a service provider for the WhatsApp API:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Twilio\Rest\Client;

class WhatsAppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        // Register the WhatsApp notification channel
        Notification::extend('whatsapp', function ($notifiable) {
            $client = new Client(
                config('services.twilio.sid'),
                config('services.twilio.token')
            );

            return new WhatsAppChannel($client);
        });
    }
}
```

This service provider defines a `boot` method that registers the WhatsApp notification channel with Laravel's notification system. You will also need to create a `WhatsAppChannel` class that implements the `send` method, which is used to send the actual notification through the WhatsApp API.

To register the service provider, add it to the `providers` array in the `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    App\Providers\WhatsAppServiceProvider::class,
],
```

With the service provider registered, you will be able to use the `via` method in the `InvoicePaid` notification class to specify that the notification should be delivered through WhatsApp.

#WhatsAppChannel

Here is an example of how the `WhatsAppChannel` class could be implemented to send a notification through the WhatsApp API:

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use Twilio\Rest\Client;

class WhatsAppChannel
{
    protected $client;

    public function __construct(Client $client)
    {
        $this->client = $client;
    }

    public function send($notifiable, Notification $notification)
    {
        $to = $notifiable->routeNotificationFor('whatsapp');

        $message = $notification->toWhatsApp($notifiable);

        $this->client->messages->create(
            $to,
            [
                'from' => config('services.twilio.whatsapp_from'),
                'body' => $message
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

Here is the complete code for the `InvoicePaid` notification class, the `WhatsAppServiceProvider` service provider, and the `WhatsAppChannel` class, all combined:

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Twilio\Rest\Client;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class InvoicePaid extends Notification
{
    protected $invoice;

    public function __construct($invoice)
    {
        $this->invoice = $invoice;
    }

    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return ['mail', 'whatsapp'];
    }

    public function toMail($notifiable)
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Your Invoice Payment')
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->line('Your invoice has been paid.')
                    ->line('Invoice number: ' . $this->invoice->number)
                    ->line('Invoice amount: $' . $this->invoice->amount)
                    ->action('View Invoice', url('/invoices/' . $this->invoice->id))
                    ->line('Thank you for your business!');
    }

    public function toWhatsApp($notifiable)
    {
        return "Your invoice has been paid.\nInvoice number: {$this->invoice->number}\nInvoice amount: {$this->invoice->amount}";
    }
}

class WhatsAppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Notification::extend('whatsapp', function ($notifiable) {
            $client = new Client(
                config('services.twilio.sid'),
                config('services.twilio.token')
            );

            return new WhatsAppChannel($client);
        });
    }
}

class WhatsAppChannel
{
    protected $client;

    public function __construct(Client $client)
    {
        $this->client = $client;
    }

    public function send($notifiable, Notification $notification)
    {
        $to = $notifiable->routeNotificationFor('whatsapp');

        $message = $notification->toWhatsApp($notifiable);

        $this->client->messages->create(
            $to,
            [
                'from' => config('services.twilio.whatsapp_from'),
                'body' => $message
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

To use these classes, you will need to register the `WhatsAppServiceProvider` service provider in the `config/app.php` file, and make sure that you have the necessary configuration values set in the `config/services.php` file for the WhatsApp API (e.g. `sid`, `token`, and `whatsapp_from`).

To include a URL in the notification message that is sent through WhatsApp, you will need to modify the `toWhatsApp` method in the `InvoicePaid` notification class.

Here is an example of how you can modify the `toWhatsApp` method to include a URL in the notification message:

```php
public function toWhatsApp($notifiable)
{
    $url = url('/invoices/' . $this->invoice->id);
    
    return "Your invoice has been paid.
    \nInvoice number: {$this->invoice->number}
    \nInvoice amount: {$this->invoice->amount}
    \nView invoice: {$url}";
}
```

# reminder
To set up a scheduled task to send a reminder notification through WhatsApp for unpaid invoices that are past their due date, you will need to use the `php artisan make:command` Artisan command to create a custom console command.

Here is an example of how you might create a custom console command to send reminder notifications for overdue invoices:

```php
use App\Invoice;
use App\Notifications\InvoiceReminder;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;

class SendInvoiceReminders extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'invoices:remind';

    protected $description = 'Send a reminder notification for overdue invoices';

    public function handle()
    {
        $overdueInvoices = Invoice::where('paid', false)
            ->where('due_date', '<', now())
            ->get();

        foreach ($overdueInvoices as $invoice) {
            Notification::send($invoice->customer, new InvoiceReminder($invoice));
        }
    }
}
```

This console command defines a `handle` method, which is called when the command is executed. The `handle` method retrieves a list of unpaid, overdue invoices from the database and sends a reminder notification through WhatsApp to the customer for each invoice using the `InvoiceReminder` notification class.

To set up a scheduled task to run this console command daily, you will need to add the following line to the `schedule` method of the `App\Console\Kernel` class:

```php
$schedule->command('invoices:remind')->daily();
```

This will schedule the `invoices:remind` command to run daily at midnight, sending a reminder notification through WhatsApp

```php
use App\Invoice;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use Twilio\Rest\Client;

class InvoiceReminder extends Notification
{
    protected $invoice;

    public function __construct(Invoice $invoice)
    {
        $this->invoice = $invoice;
    }

    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return ['whatsapp'];
    }

    public function toWhatsApp($notifiable)
    {
        $dueDate = $this->invoice->due_date->format('F j, Y');
        return "This is a reminder that your invoice is overdue.
        \nInvoice number: {$this->invoice->number}
        \nInvoice amount: {$this->invoice->amount}
        \nDue date: {$dueDate}";
    }
}
```

This notification class has a single method, `toWhatsApp`, which is used to generate the notification message that will be sent through WhatsApp. The message includes the invoice number, amount, and due date.

To use this notification class, you will need to register the `WhatsAppServiceProvider` service provider and create the #WhatsAppChannel class as I described in my previous messages.
